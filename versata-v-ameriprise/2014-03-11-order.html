  <h1>Versata v. Ameriprise order</h1>
  <p>copyright preemption</p>
  <ol>
    <li>falls within the subject matter of copyright</li>
    <li>extra element test: requires proof of one or more qualitatively different elements than a copyright infringement claim</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Though the call is a close one, the Court concludes Versata’s breach of contract claim is preempted. The rights protected by Ameriprise’s promise to return the DCM software are the same rights protected by the Copyright Act: Versata’s rights to prevent others from copying and distributing its protected work without permission. Because of the nature of the DCM software and Ameriprise’s business, Ameriprise’s ongoing use of the software is likely to result in frequent copying, reproduction, and distribution of DCM source code to Ameriprise employees and other contractors. It is Versata’s right to prevent this conduct which it seeks to enforce through its contractual return-to-sender provision. …</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Court agrees with Ameriprise [on GPL claim], though not because the GPL’s so-called “copyleft” scheme is entirely distinct from copyright law. The GPL imposes an affirmative obligation on any license holder to make the code of any derivative work freely available and open source. If the the license holder fails to comply, as Versata is alleged to have done, the GPL purports to terminate, and the license holder is potentially liable for copyright infringement for distributing or copying the software without permission. Indeed, XimpleWare currently has two copyright infringement suits against Versata pending in California based on precisely this conduct.</p>
    <p>The “viral” component of the GPL is separate and distinct from any copyright obligation. Copyright law imposes no open source obligations, and Ameriprise has not sued Versata for infringing XimpleWare’s copyright by distributing VTD-XML without permission.4 Instead, Ameriprise has sued based on Versata’s breach of an additional obligation: an affirmative promise to make its derivative work open source because it incorporated an open source program into its software. Ameriprise’s claim therefore requires an “extra element” in addition to reproduction or distribution: a failure to disclose the source code of the derivative software. <em>See Computer Assocs. Int’l</em>, 982 F.3d at 716.</p>
    <p>The presence of an additional contractual promise separate and distinct from any rights provided by the copyright laws means Ameriprise’s claim is not preempted. …</p>
