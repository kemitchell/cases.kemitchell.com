  - Violated California Penal Code 502 after receiving cease-and-desist.
quotes:
  - First, a defendant can run afoul of the CFAA when he or she has no permission to access a computer or when such permission has been revoked explicitly. Once permission has been revoked, technological gamesmanship or the enlisting of a third party to aid in access will not excuse liability.
  - Second, a violation of the terms of use of a website—without more—cannot establish liability under the CFAA.
